Hello Everyone!

Thank you for taking a look at my Capstone Project. Contained in this project is a summary of various skills I've learned and refined through the Meta Front-End Development course via Coursera. Here you will find showcases of:

- React Folder Structure
- React coding practices
- Practical use of useReducer, useState, and useEffect
- Use of Formik and Yup for form creation and validation
- a mock of an api call contained within the code as API.js
- Use of Chakra UI and other custom css
- Numerous other dependencies located within the project that can be viewed from package.json.

Instructions for running this project (for non-programmers):
